The license of the project is GPL v3.

## Source
The foundation/boilerplate of this project, along with several PowerShell functions,were copied from the exceptional M365 Documentation project, curated and maintained by the Thomas Kurt and the supportive community. You can explore their fantastic work at https://github.com/ThomasKur/M365Documentation.

Creating a PowerShell module of this complexity was a new to me, and the existing PowerShell functions from the M365 Documentation project were very important in accelerating my progress. To maintain transparency, I document all modifications directly in the respective .ps1 files. Below, you'll find a list of the files I've borrowed, providing a clear overview of what has been adapted from the original source and what I've changed to fit my needs. If I'm in violation with any GPL v3. Rules please let me know and I will change the project accordingly.
